    <h3>About Collate:Network</h3>
      <p> 
      This application will allow you to consolidate data about your WAN. This will include your IP Address information 
	  (subnets, allocations to sites/devices), information about your sites (integrated with Collate:Inventory so you 
	  don't have to enter the same information more than once), and information about your network connections between sites.
      </p>
      
    <h3>Documentation</h3>
      <p>
      Documentation for this application can be found in the docs directory that came with this distribution. You can read the 
	  documenation by clicking <a href="docs/documentation.txt">this link</a>. You can also view the documentation online at 
	  <a href="http://collate.info/">Collate.info</a>.
