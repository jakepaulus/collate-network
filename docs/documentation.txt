Collate:Network

Documentation

Many features of this application are self-explanatory and so will not be 
covered here. I will instead attempt to cover only features that may be unclear 
or functions that have multiple functionalities based on the type of user 
that is using them.



Deployment

Installing this program is a two-part process. I assume that you already have a 
PHP-enabled web server and a MySQL database server installed and configured.

Start by unpacking the zip archive you downloaded from Collate.info. Browse the 
folder you have unpacked for /include/db_connect.php. There are four settings in 
this file that you must change: the database server's IP Address/Hostname, the 
database username, the database password, and the name of the database for 
Collate:Inventory to use. The database username you specify should have full 
rights to the database.

Now that you have prepared the program, upload it to your webserver.



Installation/Upgrade

Once the files have been uploaded, browse to the install.php file on your 
webserver with any web browser. Browsing to this page will load the necessary 
tables into the database. If data already exists and Collate:Network finds a 
version number for the database, updates will be done to the schema as necessary 
to bring your program up-to-date.
